                To install Quantcast Measure with Wix, navigate to the Wix website
                editor and add your Quantcast tag as an HTML element. You'll need
                to attach the HTML element to the Header, so it's included on 
                every page.
                
                
                You can find directions for editing your header on Wix here:
